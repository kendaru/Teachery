                Pickery is a managable way of sorting and randomizing groups of people. 
                We tried to make it as easy as possible even including as much as possible, go see for yourself.

            <p>
               Groupery allows you to sort into groups of set size easily. This tool works nearly the same as Pickery.
               It is however a little more specified to work with groups.
