                Timery is a easy to use time manager. You can creat any amount of timers and have them either count up or down.
                You can have them start at any time and costumize the sounds for each. When required fullscreen mode is available.

                Pickery is a managable way of sorting and randomizing groups of people. 
                We tried to make it as easy as possible even including as much as possible, go see for yourself.

            <p>
               Groupery allows you to sort into groups of set size easily. This tool works nearly the same as Pickery.
               It is however a little more specified to work with groups.

               Here you can costumize Teachery to your liking entirely and bend it to your will with costum colors and sounds.
